## 💡 Inspiration: Why is the app created?

OpenDiary started as a personal learning project for me to actually build and practice what I have learnt with Full-stack Devlopment. At first, the idea was to create a simple blog website where I could write down my coding experiences and document what I’ve learned, as a private blog. 

As I continue to work on the project, I realized it could be more than just my personal blog. It could be a hub where everyone can share their own experiences, whether technical or personal, and they can feel comfortable to engage or follow other people and interact with them. The app is like a more special version of today's social media app, since its purpose is for us to share our learning journey, connect with like-minded people, and grow together.  

The app allows users to:
- Write and store their stories or learning notes privately, like a personal diary  
- Share posts publicly to connect with others and inspire the community  
- Download and use it as a blogging app to track progress and growth
